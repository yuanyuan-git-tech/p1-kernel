// Explanation on DAIF: ARM processor state (PSTATE) has 4 bits holding mask status for different types of interrupts. 
// **D**  Masks debug exceptions. These are a special type of synchronous exceptions. For obvious reasons, it is not possible to mask all synchronous exceptions, but it is convenient to have a separate flag that can mask debug exceptions.
// **A** Masks `SErrors`. It is called `A` because `SErrors` sometimes are called asynchronous aborts.
// **I** Masks `IRQs`
// **F** Masks `FIQs`
